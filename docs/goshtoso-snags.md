## 2026-07-27: templ runtime import

`line.templ` initially declared `import "github.com/a-h/templ"`. `templ generate`
already injects that import when the template refers to `templ.Component`, so Go
failed with `templ redeclared in this block`. Consumer and extension templates
must use templ helpers without declaring that runtime import themselves.
